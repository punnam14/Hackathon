# Hackathon on Diversity and Inclusion - Silicon Valley Edition
This project was submitted for the PowerToFly Student Hackathon (April 2022)
I worked on showcasing the gender gap and race bias at top companies in Silicon Valley. While most of us are already aware of these issues, It was really interesting to actually visualize the insights.
